    <h2>Here is some informations about External style sheet</h2>
    <p>An external style sheet is a separate file linked to an HTML web page. 
        It is a .css file that contains all the styles that need to be used on a website. 
        By using an external style sheet, you only need to set the styles <br> for each element once, 
        and if you want to update the style of your website, you only need to do it in one place.
         The external style sheet is generally used when you want to make changes on multiple pages.</p>
